This repository demonstrates an uncommon error in Java related to exception handling. The `UncommonErrorExample.java` file contains code that throws an `ArithmeticException` when attempting to divide by zero.  However, the `try-catch` block only explicitly handles `ArithmeticException`. Other unexpected exceptions during the division operation (though unlikely in this specific scenario) wouldn't be caught.  The solution file, `UncommonErrorExampleSolution.java`, shows how to improve exception handling by using a more general `Exception` catch block or handling potential exceptions in other parts of the code.
